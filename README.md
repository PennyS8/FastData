### UI Helpers
There are well-documented UI helpers in `uiHelpers.js` that allow easy creation of dialogs (like the About dialog), message bars (like the message that shows up when the app is loading or when the device is not connected to the Internet), and tabs (like the tabs that allow selecting the direction of a route). The documentation is already thorough for them, and they are fairly
easy to use, and are hence used all throughout the code.
